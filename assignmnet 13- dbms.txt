 1) Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, and ratings of all customers. 
 Those with rating of 200 or greater will also have the words “High Rating”, while the others will have the words “Low Rating”.

Ans: select cname, city, rating, case when rating then 'High Rating' end as Remarks from customers where rating>=200
				                           union
     select cname, city, rating, case when rating then 'Low Rating' end as Remarks from customers where rating<200;

 3) Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in San Jose; the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose;
 and the third the onums of all orders on October 3. Retain duplicates between the last two queries but eliminate
any redundancies between either of them and the first.
(Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. This is besides the point.)

ans- select snum from salepeople where city='san jose'
		                union
     select cnum from customers where city='san jose'
			      union all
     select onum from orders where odate='1990-10-03';
